    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "In this lab we'll examine one method for performing changepoint detection on a signal (in this case, features from songs). The intuition is that we're roughly going to find a time point $t$ where the mean of the features before $t$ is as far as possible from the mean of the features after $t$. This $t$ is then our estimate of where the song changes the most.\n",

    "## 2 Kernel-based changepoint algorithm\n",
    "We're going to try to locate one changepoint in a song. The idea behind the algorithm is that the features of the song before the changepoint are going to be similar, and the features after the changepoint are going to be similar. Hence, we will look for the time $t$ at which the standardized distance (defined below) from the mean of the features before time $t$ to the mean of the features after time $t$ is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are going to do this with kernels. Recall that as long as a kernel is positive semi-definite, we can write the kernel as an inner product:\n",
    "$$k(x,x') = \\langle\\phi(x), \\phi(x')\\rangle_\\mathcal{H}$$\n",
    "for some function $\\phi$. If we specify a kernel $k$, we (possibly implicitly) use $\\phi(x_1), \\phi(x_2), \\dots, \\phi(x_T)$ as our new features instead of $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following setup: The song is described by a sequence of features $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T\\in\\mathbf{X}$. Let $k:\\mathbf{X}\\times\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a kernel function between the features and $\\phi:\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathcal{H}$ be the associated feature map. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to solve the following problem:\n",
    "$$ \\text{argmax}_{t\\in \\{1,...,T-1\\}} \\frac{t(T-t)}{T} \\|\\hat\\mu_1-\\hat\\mu_2\\|^2_\\mathcal{H},$$\n",
    "where $\\hat\\mu_1=\\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\phi(x_i)$ and $\\hat\\mu_2=\\frac{1}{T-t} \\sum_{i=t+1}^{T} \\phi(x_i)$. The value $t$ that maximizes the above expression will be correspond to the last index in our estimated first part of the song. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we don't know $\\phi$, but just know $k$? Or what if we know $\\phi$, but it's infinite-dimensional? It turns out that this is not an issue because we can rewrite the objective function using only $k$, as noted in Exercise 1."

    "2. Create bag-of-words features:\n",
    "  1. Take a subset of the songs that you are not going to test on (I took 1000 songs) and do the following:\n",
    "    - Stack the features from each segment of each song into one very long matrix. The number of columns will be the number of features in each segment.\n",
    "    - Center and scale the features.\n",
    "    - Run PCA and transform the features. The number of principal components I used is the number that explained 95% of the variance.\n",
    "    - Run K-means on the data and store the cluster centers. I used 1024 clusters.\n",
    "  2. On each song you are going to test on, do the following:\n",
    "    - Stack all of the features from each segment of the song.\n",
    "    - Center and scale the features *using the mean and standard deviation from the previous set of songs*.\n",
    "    - Transform the features using the principal components from the previous set of songs.\n",
    "    - Mirror the features from the first and last 2.5 seconds of the song, so that the song is effectively 5s longer. This allows us to capture more of what happens at the very beginning and very end of the song.\n",
    "    - Create a matrix of zeros of dimension # 5s intervals x # cluster centers.\n",
    "    - For each segment in each consecutive 5s window (with an overlap of 20%), find the closest cluster center and add 1 to the element of the above matrix corresponding to this interval and that cluster center.\n",
    "    - Normalize the histograms you just created so they sum to 1. These histograms are your features for each 5s interval of your song."
